Title: A Journey Through the Web: What Happens When You Type "https://www.google.com" in Your Browser and Press Enter?
Introduction: When we type a URL like "https://www.google.com" into our web browser and hit Enter, a complex series of steps take place behind the scenes to bring us the desired webpage. In this blog post, we will unravel the intricate journey of a web request, covering key components such as DNS requests, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load-balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases. Let's dive in!
    1. DNS Request: The process begins with a DNS (Domain Name System) request. The browser extracts the domain name from the URL ("www.google.com") and sends a DNS query to a DNS server. The DNS server translates the human-readable domain name into an IP address, such as "215.98.207.56", enabling the browser to locate the correct server on the internet.
    2. TCP/IP: Once the browser has obtained the IP address, it establishes a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) connection with the server. TCP ensures reliable data transmission by breaking the information into packets, while IP handles addressing and routing those packets across the internet.
    3. Firewall: In many cases, the server is protected by a firewallâ€”a security barrier that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. The firewall examines the packets from the browser, verifying that they meet the necessary criteria to proceed. If all checks pass, the packets are allowed to continue to the server.
    4. HTTPS/SSL: If the website uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), an extra layer of security is employed. The browser and server engage in an SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) handshake, exchanging encryption keys to establish an encrypted connection. This ensures that the data exchanged between the browser and the server remains confidential and cannot be easily intercepted by third parties.
    5. Load-Balancer: In the case of high-traffic websites, load-balancers come into play. A load-balancer acts as a traffic cop, distributing incoming requests across multiple web servers to ensure efficient handling. It helps maintain stability, scalability, and redundancy in the face of heavy user demand.
    6. Web Server: Once the connection is established, the web server receives the HTTP request from the browser. The web server is responsible for processing the request and generating a response. In our example, the Google server will interpret the request and locate the appropriate webpage or perform the requested action, such as displaying search results.
    7. Application Server: In some cases, the web server communicates with an application server to process dynamic content. The application server executes server-side scripts, interacts with databases, and performs complex business logic. It generates a dynamic response based on the request received from the web server.
    8. Database: If the application server needs to retrieve or store data, it connects to a database. The database stores and manages structured information required for the website's functionality. In the case of Google, databases would store indexed web pages, user preferences, and various other data.
Conclusion: When you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and hit Enter, a fascinating journey begins. From the initial DNS request to the final database interactions, each step plays a crucial role in delivering the desired webpage. Understanding this process not only enhances our knowledge of web technologies but also highlights the complexity behind seemingly simple interactions. So, the next time you search the web, remember the intricate dance that takes place behind the scenes.
